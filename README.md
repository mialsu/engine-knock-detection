# Detection of engine knock with machine learning
Part of project work with real engine pressure data from UTU/Aalto University course Machine Learning in Material Science.

The project was about detecting engine knock from a cylinder pressure curve of a traditional otto-engine. Each of the pressure curves were split to 10, 15, 20 and 30 parts and then variance of each part was calculated to form the data that was later consumed by various ML models.

Models I implemented were a traditional neural network model and a naive bayes classifier which are found in the repository.
